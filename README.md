# SteamIngameActivator
Im still learning how to code, if you see this, i'd welcome some help :(

The goal is to create an application that works without the need of installing any .net, like how any lightweight application should work nowadays
With the ability to read steam_appid.txt, change its contents in the same window, save the edited txt file, then select the game exe, and launch it with another button
