# SteamIngameActivator

Steam In-Game Activator is here! Its simple, but great!
It saves your settings into a settings.cfg right next to the exe, so you dont even have to type them in later!

Compiled with Visual studio 2019, .NET Framework 4.8 (although you shouldnt need .NET to run it....)

1.0 is DONE!
Binaries ADDED!
Graphical flair coming soon!
